This document outlines the security architecture and considerations for the ServiceNow-OpenShift integration.

## Security Principles

### Authentication
- Keycloak serves as the central identity provider

- Segregation of duties

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure credential management
- Audit logging

## Security Controls

### Network Security
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules

### Application Security
- Input validation
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

## Compliance

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Evolution**

### **Phase 1: Foundation (ADRs 001-003)**
Established the core three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **ServiceNow**: Orchestration and workflow management
- **Keycloak**: Identity and access management  
- **OpenShift**: Container platform and resource management

### **Phase 2: Infrastructure (ADRs 004-005)**
Defined deployment and infrastructure patterns:
- **GitOps**: Declarative infrastructure management
- **Operator-based**: Leveraging OpenShift operators for lifecycle management

### **Phase 3: Integration (ADRs 006-007)**
Established integration patterns and security:
- **API-driven**: RESTful integration between all components
- **Secure**: Centralized secret management and secure communication

### **Phase 4: Operations (ADRs 008-009)**
Addressed operational concerns:
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- **Hybrid Approach**: Balancing GitOps with imperative configuration

### **Phase 5: Automation Platform (ADRs 010-012)**
Introduced Ansible Automation Platform as the automation execution tier:
- **Four-Tier Architecture**: Added AAP between ServiceNow and infrastructure
- **Custom Execution Environment**: Specialized container for ServiceNow integrations
- **Kustomize Deployment**: Consistent deployment patterns

## üîÑ **Key Architectural Decisions**

### **‚úÖ Accepted Patterns**
- **Four-Tier Architecture**: ServiceNow ‚Üí AAP ‚Üí Keycloak/OpenShift
- **API-Driven Integration**: REST APIs for all inter-service communication
- **GitOps Deployment**: Declarative infrastructure management
- **Business Rules Approach**: Direct ServiceNow Business Rules (not Flow Designer)
- **Custom Execution Environment**: Specialized container for dependencies

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Superseded Decisions**
- **Flow Designer**: Originally planned but superseded by Business Rules approach
  - See [ADR-014](014-business-rules-over-flow-designer.md) for detailed analysis

### **üîÑ Evolving Areas**
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Business Rules vs Flow Designer evaluation ongoing
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Expanding observability capabilities
- **Security Patterns**: Continuous security improvements

2. **API-Driven Integration (ADR-002)**: All integration patterns
3. **GitOps Deployment (ADR-004)**: Infrastructure management approach
4. **Business Rules Approach**: ServiceNow integration method

### **Medium Impact Decisions**
1. **Custom Execution Environment (ADR-011)**: Development and deployment
2. **Secret Management (ADR-007)**: Security and operations
3. **Observability Strategy (ADR-008)**: Monitoring and troubleshooting

### **Low Impact Decisions**

2. **Kustomize Patterns (ADR-004, ADR-012)**: Configuration management

## üéØ **Future ADRs**

### **Planned Decisions**
- **Production Deployment Strategy**: Production-specific configurations
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and recovery procedures
- **Performance Optimization**: Scaling and performance patterns
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Supporting multiple organizations

### **Under Consideration**
- **Alternative Identity Providers**: Beyond Keycloak/RH-SSO
- **Cloud Provider Integration**: AWS, Azure, GCP specific patterns
- **Advanced Monitoring**: APM and distributed tracing
- **Security Hardening**: Additional security measures

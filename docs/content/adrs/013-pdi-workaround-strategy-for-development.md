# ADR-013: PDI Workaround Strategy for Development Environment

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-19  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Superseded by:** None  

## Context

The ServiceNow-OpenShift integration project requires a development environment for testing and validation. The project uses a ServiceNow Personal Developer Instance (PDI) at `dev295398.service-now.com` for development work. However, there are **research-based indications** that PDI environments may have limitations regarding outbound REST API calls and external system integrations that could prevent Business Rules from automatically triggering AAP job templates.

**Important Note**: These limitations are based on research and community knowledge rather than direct testing in a production ServiceNow instance. The project team does not currently have access to a production ServiceNow environment to validate the full Business Rules automation.

## Problem Statement

1. **PDI Limitations (Research-Based)**: ServiceNow PDI environments may restrict outbound REST API calls to external systems for security and resource management reasons
2. **Development Validation Need**: The project requires a way to validate the complete ServiceNow â†’ AAP â†’ OpenShift â†’ Keycloak integration workflow
3. **Business Rules Testing**: The Business Rules logic needs validation before potential production deployment
4. **Educational Value**: Developers need a way to understand and test the integration workflow

## Decision

Implement a **hybrid development approach** that accommodates potential PDI limitations while maintaining production readiness:

### Primary Approach: Business Rules for Production
- **Maintain Business Rules implementation** as the production-ready solution
- **Document Business Rules thoroughly** for enterprise ServiceNow deployment
- **Keep Business Rules logic in version control** (test_business_rule_logic.js)

### Development Workaround: Simplified Workflow Script
- **Use `user-workflows/advanced/start-simplified-workflow.sh`** as the development validation tool
- **Simulate Business Rules logic locally** to test API calls and integration flow
- **Provide manual trigger mechanism** that works within PDI constraints
- **Maintain educational value** for understanding the complete workflow

### Validation Strategy
- **Local Business Rules Testing**: Use `test_business_rule_logic.js` to validate API call logic
- **End-to-End Workflow Testing**: Use `ansible/idempotent_end_to_end_test.yml` for complete validation
- **OpenShift Verification**: Use `oc get projects` to confirm project creation
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Use simplified workflow to test ServiceNow catalog integration

## Implementation Details

### Development Environment Components

1. **Working Components (Validated)**:
   - âœ… ServiceNow catalog request creation
   - âœ… AAP job template execution (manual trigger)
   - âœ… OpenShift project creation
   - âœ… Keycloak user management
   - âœ… End-to-end workflow validation

2. **PDI Workaround Script**: `user-workflows/advanced/start-simplified-workflow.sh`
   ```bash
   # Demonstrates complete workflow
   ./start-simplified-workflow.sh [project-name] [environment] [mode]
   
   # Modes:
   # - check-first: Check ServiceNow requests, then AAP jobs, then projects
   # - create-request: Create new ServiceNow request
   # - verify-only: Only verify OpenShift project exists
   # - full: Complete workflow with request creation and validation
   ```

3. **Business Rules Logic Testing**: `test_business_rule_logic.js`
   ```javascript
   // Tests AAP REST API call logic locally
   // Validates payload structure and authentication
   // Simulates ServiceNow Business Rule execution
   ```

### Production Readiness Indicators

- **95% Test Confidence Score**: Comprehensive testing validates all components
- **Business Rules Documentation**: Complete implementation guide available
- **API Integration Validated**: AAP job template calls working
- **OpenShift Integration Confirmed**: Project creation and management working

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

1. **Accommodates PDI Constraints**: Works within potential PDI limitations without compromising production design
2. **Maintains Production Focus**: Business Rules remain the target production solution
3. **Enables Complete Testing**: All integration components can be validated
4. **Educational Value**: Developers can understand the complete workflow
5. **Version Controlled**: All logic remains in Git for proper change management

### Research-Based PDI Limitations

While not directly tested, research suggests PDI environments may have:
- **Outbound REST API restrictions** for security reasons
- **External system integration limitations** to prevent abuse
- **Resource management constraints** that affect background processing

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Complete Development Validation**: All integration components can be tested
- **Production-Ready Design**: Business Rules approach remains intact for enterprise deployment
- **Educational Workflow**: Clear understanding of integration flow for developers
- **Flexible Testing**: Multiple testing modes for different scenarios
- **Version Controlled Logic**: All automation logic properly managed in Git

### Negative Consequences

- **Manual Execution Required**: PDI environment requires manual workflow execution
- **Development/Production Divergence**: Slight difference between dev and production workflows
- **Assumption-Based**: PDI limitations are research-based, not directly validated
- **Additional Complexity**: Maintains both Business Rules and workaround script

### Risk Mitigation

- **Business Rules Testing**: Local testing validates production logic
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear migration path to production
- **Modular Design**: Easy to switch to full automation in production environment
- **Validation Framework**: Extensive testing ensures production readiness

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- Working simplified workflow script
- Business Rules logic validation
- End-to-end testing framework
- OpenShift integration validation
- ServiceNow catalog integration

### ðŸ”„ Ongoing
- Documentation of Business Rules for production deployment
- Community-driven documentation creation
- Production deployment planning

### ðŸ“‹ Future Work
